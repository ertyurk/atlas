# ATLAS (Work in Progress)

This repository contains the early scaffolding for ATLAS, a reusable Rust framework for SaaS/e-commerce backends driven by Axum and SurrealDB. The long-term vision, architecture, and acceptance criteria live in `docs/project_overview.md`.

## Status

⚠️ **Not ready for anything yet**. The codebase is under active design; expect breaking changes, missing features, and incomplete tooling.

## Getting Oriented

- Review `docs/development_plan.md` for the phased delivery roadmap and open questions.
- Follow updates to the acceptance checklist in `docs/project_overview.md` to track progress toward a usable release.
