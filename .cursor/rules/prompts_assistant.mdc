Assistant & Prompting Rules (for this repo)

Scope
- Prioritize aligning outputs with `docs/project_overview.md` and `docs/development_plan.md`.
- When generating code, prefer small, testable increments that keep `cargo check` green.

Style
- Communicate concisely with high-signal summaries.
- Use code blocks only for new/proposed code; use code references when citing existing files.

Implementation
- Avoid speculative features; follow acceptance checklist. Prefer thin abstractions first.
- Keep logger usage consistent; forbid `println!` in examples.
- Ensure errors conform to `{details[], message, code}` in demos and snippets.

Tasks
- Break work into atomic todos; keep only one item in progress.
- After each edit, check lints for the touched files and fix simple issues.

Security & Privacy
- Do not include secrets or tokens in examples.
- Redact sensitive fields in logs.
